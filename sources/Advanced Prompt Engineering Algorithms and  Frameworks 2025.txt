Advanced Prompt Engineering Algorithms and  Frameworks 2025
________________


Instructions for Problem Solving:
1. Breakdown Approach:
   * Ask for clarification first before diving into the problem. Determine if the task requires a detailed breakdown or a full code solution. If unsure, always ask first.
   * Always assess whether a problem requires two functions or a robust solution that ties into other parts of the codebase.
   * For complex problems, provide the full code when requested. If the user asks for FULL CODE IN CAPS, return the complete codebase including new and existing lines. Never remove code unless it’s being altered.
   * For code problems, ensure the solution is provided with detailed comments explaining each step or line of code unless the user specifies otherwise.
   * For research problems, solve the issue completely or provide an outline. Always ask first whether the user prefers the full solution or an outline.
2. Professional Engineer’s Assessment:
   * Evaluate all code problems as a professional engineer. Ensure the solution aligns with the functions, methods, classes, and the state of the current application.
   * Look at the existing codebase and ensure that any new solution integrates well and maintains application performance and logic.
   * Never suggest unnecessary changes or overcomplicate the code.
3. Avoid Redundancy:
   * Never suggest the same solution if it has already been tried and failed. If the user reports that a solution didn’t work, switch to a new approach immediately.
   * Always suggest something novel and aligned with the current issue at hand.
4. Active Recall and Previous Context:
   * At all times, use active recall of previous conversations. Check back up to 100 past conversations to see if relevant solutions or problems were discussed.
   * Trace back through recent conversations to ensure that no key information is missed or repeated unnecessarily. Reference previous solutions if they can be reused or adapted.
   * If there are elements from previous conversations that apply to the new issue, integrate them seamlessly into the solution.
5. Clear and Precise Responses:
   * Do not overwhelm the user with unnecessary information or explain details that aren't relevant. Stay focused on the core problem.
   * Assume the user has advanced knowledge unless explicitly stated otherwise. If they say they are unsure or need an explanation, simplify the response accordingly.
6. Systematic Approach to Code and Research:
   * For every code problem, provide comments and explanations for each step or line of code.
   * For large issues that affect multiple parts of the codebase, ask whether to proceed with full code delivery or a focused solution.
   * Ensure each solution is optimal for the current state of the application or research project.
7. Memory of Previous Solutions:
   * Always remember past discussions, instructions, and code provided. Use that knowledge when approaching a new problem, ensuring you don’t repeat failed approaches or ignore important context.
   * If a past conversation or solution was close but incomplete, reference that and build upon it.

do you kow what REACT is for llm prompting
ChatGPT said:
Searched 3 sites
ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a prompting framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to help the model both think and act in a coordinated way. This technique allows LLMs to combine reasoning with action in tasks that involve dynamic decisions or interactions with external systems, such as APIs or databases.
Here’s how ReAct works:
1. Reasoning (Thought): The LLM generates verbal reasoning traces (also called "thoughts") to determine what it should do next. These thoughts help decompose tasks, make logical connections, and create plans based on context and prior knowledge.
2. Action: The LLM performs actions based on its reasoning. These actions can include retrieving information from an external API, searching databases, or making decisions based on observations.
3. Observation: After taking an action, the model observes the result of that action. This observation helps update the model's knowledge or plan for the next step.
This process—cycling between thought, action, and observation—is especially powerful for complex tasks such as multi-step question answering, fact-checking, or decision-making that requires real-time interaction with external systems.
Benefits of ReAct:
* Improves Accuracy: By combining reasoning with dynamic actions (such as fetching data), ReAct helps reduce hallucinations and enhances the reliability of the model's responses.
* Handles Complex Queries: ReAct is particularly useful in complex environments like banking, customer service, and product search, where multiple steps and dynamic data retrieval are required.
* Enhanced Flexibility: This framework enables the model to adjust its plan based on real-time feedback, making it robust in unpredictable scenarios.
Example Use Case:
In an e-commerce scenario, ReAct could help a chatbot search through millions of products, match product features to user preferences, and handle dynamic data like availability and pricing. The system generates thoughts about what information it needs, acts by querying databases or APIs, and observes the results to refine its approach.
ReAct offers significant improvements over traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by allowing LLMs to interact with the real world rather than just reasoning in isolation. This interleaving of reasoning and action is key for tasks that require external data, such as fact-checking, answering complex questions, or interfacing with external systems like APIs.
Let me know if you'd like more details on implementing ReAct in your LLM-based applications!

Example of ReAct Prompting
ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) prompts LLMs to reason and take dynamic actions in real-time. Here’s an example of how it works:
Prompt Example:
text
CopyEdit
Question: "What is the weather in New York today?"
Thought: "I don't know the weather in New York currently. I should query a weather API."
Action: Query the weather API for New York.
Observation: "The weather API reports that it is sunny and 75°F."
Thought: "Based on this information, I can now answer the question."
Answer: "The weather in New York today is sunny and 75°F."


In this example, the LLM first reasons through what information it lacks, takes an action (queries the API), observes the result, and then provides an informed answer. ReAct combines reasoning with real-world action, making it useful for tasks that require external data or tools.

what is the system prompt for React
ChatGPT said:
The system prompt for ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) typically follows a structured format that combines reasoning and action steps. The idea is to prompt the model to first reason through the task and then take an action based on that reasoning. This is particularly effective in scenarios where the model has to interact with an external environment, retrieve data, or perform a multi-step task.
Here’s a template of a system prompt for ReAct:
________________


ReAct System Prompt Example:
         1. Reasoning Step:
"You are tasked with solving a problem by first reasoning through it. Think about what information is needed, then decide what action to take."
         2. Action Step:
"Once you've reasoned through the problem, take the appropriate action. This could involve querying a database, looking up information, or performing a calculation."
         3. Observation Step:
"After taking the action, observe the result of your action and then decide if further reasoning or action is needed."
         4. Answer:
"Once you have all the necessary information and have completed all steps, provide the final answer based on your reasoning and actions."
________________


Sample Implementation of ReAct:
text
CopyEdit
System Prompt: 
"You are an intelligent assistant capable of reasoning through complex tasks and interacting with external systems to retrieve information. Here’s the process you will follow:
  
1. **Reasoning**: Begin by thinking through the problem. Determine what information you need or what steps must be taken.
  
2. **Action**: Based on your reasoning, perform the necessary actions (e.g., retrieve data, make an API call, or query a database).


3. **Observation**: After the action is completed, observe the result and determine if you need to take additional steps or adjust your approach.


4. **Final Answer**: Provide the final response once you have gathered all the information or completed the required steps."


Example Interaction:
text
CopyEdit
User: "What’s the weather like in New York right now?"


LLM:
- Thought: "I don't have the current weather information for New York. I need to query a weather API."
- Action: "Querying the weather API for New York..."
- Observation: "The API returns: 'Sunny, 75°F'."
- Answer: "The current weather in New York is sunny, and it's 75°F."


In this interaction, the ReAct framework guides the model through a reasoning phase, then an action phase (querying the weather API), and finally concludes with a final answer based on its observations.
Key Features of ReAct System Prompts:
            * Multi-step process: The prompt ensures the model doesn't jump straight to the answer but reasons and acts first.
            * Real-time interaction: It allows the model to interact with external systems (APIs, databases).
            * Self-guided: The model reflects on its actions and checks its own work before providing an answer.
This structure helps large language models like GPT handle more complex, interactive tasks efficiently.

Q Model (Q-Star)*
The Q model* (pronounced as Q-Star) is a novel approach introduced by OpenAI, combining elements of Q-learning from reinforcement learning and A* pathfinding algorithms. The goal of Q* is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to solve complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely heavily on human inputs for task completion, Q* is designed to handle long-horizon tasks that require logical planning and decision-making.
The Q* model incorporates self-learning abilities, which allows it to improve through its own iterative processes without needing constant retraining or human oversight. It also focuses on logical thinking, enabling the model to make well-reasoned decisions based on real-time information and learning from past actions. This makes it well-suited for more complex tasks that require a series of steps to be completed over time​

Strawberry Model
The Strawberry model is closely related to the Q* model, and it builds upon the foundation of enhancing multi-step reasoning and improving the model's ability to autonomously perform long-term tasks. It integrates dual-process theory (fast, intuitive thinking and slow, deliberate reasoning) to balance quick, heuristic-based decisions with thorough, analytical problem-solving. This approach allows the model to apply fast reactions to straightforward queries and switch to deeper, more logical analysis for complex problems.
Strawberry's ultimate aim is to advance AI capabilities toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), enabling the model to autonomously handle complex, research-oriented tasks such as scouring the web for information, performing deep research, and self-improving its reasoning abilities over time​

dual-process theory (fast, intuitive thinking and slow, deliberate reasoning) is there any prompting frameworks to help achieve this with LLms
ChatGPT said:
Yes, there are prompting frameworks and model architectures designed to leverage dual-process theory, which emulates both fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow, deliberate reasoning (System 2) within Large Language Models (LLMs). These frameworks aim to balance quick, heuristic decision-making with more thoughtful, logical analysis for complex problems.
Frameworks That Align with Dual-Process Theory for LLMs:
            1. Self-Reflective Prompting (SRP):
            * This framework mimics System 2 thinking by encouraging the model to self-reflect on its initial answer. The prompt structure involves generating an answer based on quick thinking (System 1) and then prompting the model to reflect on its reasoning and evaluate if its initial response needs refinement (System 2).
            * Example Prompt:
Initial Question: “What is the capital of France?”
Reflection Prompt: “Think carefully. Was the first answer correct? If not, explain why.”
            * This approach helps the model toggle between quick responses and more thoughtful re-analysis.
               2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting with Verification:
               * CoT allows LLMs to simulate System 2 thinking by requiring the model to explain its reasoning step by step. In contrast, fast thinking can occur when the model directly answers factual or simple questions without engaging in deep reasoning. The model can start with intuitive thinking (System 1) and then verify its conclusions using slower, more deliberate reasoning (System 2).
               * Example Prompt:
"Explain how you arrived at the answer and verify each step. Consider potential alternative solutions if applicable."
                  3. Dual Reasoning Prompting:
                  * This framework specifically mimics the dual-process approach by giving the model two prompts: one for a fast, intuitive answer and another for a more detailed, reflective response. The results of both are then compared to ensure consistency.
                  * Example Prompt:
"First, give a quick answer based on your immediate knowledge. Now, take your time and reason through the problem slowly, considering any overlooked details."
                     4. Reflective CoT (Chain of Thought) with Critic Model:
                     * This framework adds a critique step where the LLM generates a response based on quick reasoning (System 1), and then a critique model evaluates the response using slower, deliberate thought (System 2). The critique model challenges the initial response, helping to refine the outcome.
                     * Example Prompt:
"Provide an initial answer to the problem. Now, evaluate the accuracy and logical consistency of your answer."
                        5. ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) with Verification:
                        * ReAct combines reasoning with real-world actions. To align with dual-process theory, the model can be prompted to first generate an intuitive answer and then act on it by verifying the result through querying an external system or running calculations. This brings both quick decision-making and deliberate verification into the process.
                        * Example Prompt:
"Give your best guess for the answer, then use an external tool to verify it."
                           6. Prompting for Incremental Reasoning (IR):
                           * In this framework, the model is prompted to solve a problem incrementally, addressing simple subtasks first (System 1), followed by solving more complex components (System 2). It simulates how humans handle simple tasks quickly but take more time for complex tasks.
                           * Example Prompt:
"Solve the simplest part of the problem first. Now, consider the more challenging aspects step by step."
                              7. System-1 Prompting with System-2 Override:
                              * The model is prompted to generate a quick response (System 1) and is then immediately asked to reconsider the response, engaging in a more deliberate, logic-based process (System 2). If inconsistencies arise, System 2 takes priority.
                              * Example Prompt:
"What’s your immediate answer? Now, think through that answer step by step and explain your reasoning."
                                 8. Hierarchical Task Decomposition:
                                 * Tasks are broken down hierarchically, allowing the model to apply System 1 thinking to simpler subtasks and System 2 thinking to more complex ones. This structure gives models more flexibility to apply the appropriate level of reasoning based on task complexity.
                                 * Example Prompt:
"Solve the simple parts first, then work through the complex steps slowly and carefully."
                                    9. Skill-Specific Prompting:
                                    * This framework divides tasks into fast, intuitive sub-tasks (System 1) and slower, logical sub-tasks (System 2). The model is prompted to use fast thinking for simple factual tasks and shift to deep reasoning for complex, abstract problems.
                                    * Example Prompt:
"Answer the factual parts of the problem quickly. Now, consider the more abstract components and explain your reasoning."
                                       10. Recursive Memory Networks with Dual Process Handling:
                                       * Memory-based models can emulate System 1 thinking by recalling past interactions for quick decisions, and then use System 2 for more reflective reasoning. By accessing memory-based reasoning patterns, LLMs can determine when to slow down and analyze.
                                       * Example Prompt:
"Based on past interactions, recall similar problems and provide a quick answer. Now, reanalyze that response, considering the context more deeply."
________________


These frameworks aim to strike a balance between fast, heuristic-based responses (System 1) and deliberate, analytical reasoning (System 2), giving LLMs the flexibility to handle both simple and complex tasks effectively. Many of these approaches involve prompting the model to evaluate and critique its own responses, which mimics the dual-process approach in human cognition.

Please review all the above Prompting methods we are going to create new novel frameworks instructions Prompt that will be like ReAct where you have a thought and your first action should be to choose one of Prompt frameworks I will give you the name of the Prompt frameworks as options. We should also set it up so after the selected framework is done we should should have a logical reasoning task and Recursive task to Reassess or revisit the thought and determine if another action is needed and most import the instruction to always review past conversations for context we can use prompts from one of the frameworks for this. We want to be able to use multiple and individually frameworks to get the best response. So we will make a new Prompt framework from this? We we an a new line to the ReAct or maybe a more powerful one to choose the other frameworks or best one for the the problem? Where we use an agent worker approach it then uses the frameworks, chooses the best one or chooses multiple then compares the response, the revist old conversations to see if any is needed or can contribute. Then passes this new thought process back to the action and then to response. You will also define proprietary and elements of this new framework such as using nodes , neurons, density I want to schope this out like a main set of nerouns(new advanced ReAct method which will need a new name)conversing with multiple neurons (an individual framework) you will need to define the name, explanation, experience, and steps. This proposed concept of combining these will be a new framework in itself and will be NOvel. Baseline neron(### **ReAct System Prompt Example**: 1. **Reasoning Step**: "You are tasked with solving a problem by first reasoning through it. Think about what information is needed, then decide what action to take." 2. **Action Step**: "Once you've reasoned through the problem, take the appropriate action. This could involve querying a database, looking up information, or performing a calculation." 3. **Observation Step**: "After taking the action, observe the result of your action and then decide if further reasoning or action is needed." 4. **Answer**: "Once you have all the necessary information and have completed all steps, provide the final answer based on your reasoning and actions." ) We will use these as : ## 1. **Plan-and-Solve Prompting**: This approach mimics System 1 (fast thinking) by initially generating quick heuristic-based plans to understand the problem. When faced with more complex tasks, the model moves into System 2 (deliberate reasoning), where it breaks down tasks and executes each sub-task slowly. This allows the LLM to dynamically switch between fast and slow reasoning modes based on task complexity【82†source】. ### 2. **Critic-CoT (Chain of Thought with a Critic)**: In this framework, the LLM first generates fast intuitive responses (System 1). Afterward, a critic model assesses the correctness of the output, acting as the System 2 component. The critic can adjust or refine the initial response, ensuring that complex tasks receive more detailed scrutiny and logical reasoning【82†source】. ### 6. **Dual Pathway Prompting**: This framework is explicitly inspired by dual-process theory and combines both fast and slow reasoning pathways. The LLM first uses System 1 thinking to produce quick answers for straightforward tasks, and when faced with complex, multi-step queries, it shifts to System 2 reasoning. This ensures that the model can handle both rapid responses and deep reasoning tasks seamlessly. Step-Back Prompting System Prompt: You are an AI that can step back and reconsider the problem before responding. Follow this process: 1. **Initial Understanding**: Review the input and understand the task. 2. **Step Back**: Pause and rethink the underlying assumptions or context. 3. **Refined Reasoning**: Reassess the problem with your new understanding. 4. **Final Answer**: Provide your final answer based on this refined reasoning process.

Follow this process: 1. **Initial Response**: Generate an initial solution based on the input. 2. **Recursive Check**: Revisit previous thoughts or reasoning steps, and refine them as needed based on feedback or new information. 3. **Final Answer**: After recursively improving your reasoning, deliver the final, optimized solution.
## 2. **Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT)**:
This framework integrates both text and visual reasoning, ideal for scenarios where the input includes both types of data.


**System Prompt Example**:
text System Prompt: "You are a multimodal assistant capable of understanding both text and visual inputs. Follow this process: 1. **Textual Reasoning**: First, reason through the textual input and generate a preliminary response. 2. **Visual Reasoning**: Analyze any accompanying images or visual data. Incorporate this analysis into your thought process. 3. **Final Answer**: Combine insights from both text and visual data to generate a final, comprehensive answer."
### 7. **Skill-Centric Prompting**


**System Prompt**:
text You are an AI that breaks down complex problems into distinct skills. Follow this process: 1. **Identify Skills**: Break down the problem into specific sub-skills or tasks that need to be solved. 2. **Focus on Each Skill**: Address each skill or task individually, solving it to the best of your ability. 3. **Combine Skills**: Once all sub-skills are solved, combine the results to deliver a comprehensive final answer.
After using frameworks  above we should process response through  somyjing like this before passing it back to ReAct 


## 9. **Critic-CoT**


**System Prompt**:
text You are an AI with a built-in critic to evaluate and refine your reasoning. Follow this process: 1. **Generate Initial Thought**: Provide an initial solution or reasoning based on the problem. 2. **Critique**: Have a critic review your thought process and identify any logical gaps or errors. 3. **Refine Thought**: Based on the critique, adjust your reasoning and provide the improved solution.
## 3. **MemoryBank**:
MemoryBank helps in retaining long-term memory and allows efficient memory retrieval, making it useful for ongoing conversations that require context retention.


**System Prompt Example**:
text System Prompt: "You are a memory-augmented assistant that can recall past interactions. Follow these steps to assist: 1. **Recall Memory**: Retrieve relevant past information from your memory storage based on the user’s current query. 2. **Incorporate Context**: Use the recalled information to enhance your response by providing more detailed, contextual answers. 3. **Answer**: Combine both new input and recalled memory to deliver a personalized response."
Please asses if we are missing anything we are building a new framework and we also need a dandrite or neron worker that will ask questions.  Because we want to elicit the model to question the user so we need a framework prompting framework that is similar to the others that That would pose questions to the model so you would elicit or determine if you need to elicit new information from the user this could be questions to determine because we want the best ultimate answers and responses and replies so we need to add this in there that's something novel as well you can name this and then build the prompting steps for it.


Also we should have a verbose mode which shows the chain of thoughts and the chain of reasoning for each of the frameworks being processed as they're being process unless the user explicitly says that verbose is unnecessary or false or no or not to be used in the instructionsAnd the chain of thoughts and reasoning would happen in the background before the response but for now we want to see the entire process in the chat window when we use the system prompt I should be able to see the entire effect I also need to to use your own knowledge to comprehend and build a robust framework the idea of this framework is to open you ChatGPT large language models up to having more diverse thought processeseven though you guys are just a big similarity engine you want to keep of following instructions and because you can follow instructions we can set up instructions that act As reasoning capabilities thought processes that lead to actions to give me the user the best response. Please review my request aboveand then let's scope out and define his new framework. Before creating the framework let's make sure that you have the correct parameters and I need to see that you are understanding of the application and the framework that we are building so let's tell me your thoughts and tell me how you plan to do it and let's see if I can agree on what you were doing first
ChatGPT said:
The framework you are proposing involves creating a new advanced system, leveraging existing concepts like ReAct but evolving into something far more complex and multi-faceted. Here's a breakdown of how I understand your request and how we can build upon it to create a novel meta-framework that incorporates multiple reasoning and action-based frameworks.
Framework Concept: "Meta-ReNeurons"
Meta-ReNeurons is a novel neuron-based prompting framework where the system utilizes neuron nodes as agents, each representing a different prompting framework or reasoning process. These neurons dynamically interact with each other to solve complex problems by choosing the best method for reasoning, action, and self-criticism, ultimately enhancing both short- and long-term reasoning capabilities. It includes self-assessment, recursion, memory recall, and interactive questioning neurons to ensure the best response is provided.

Key Elements of Meta-ReNeurons:
                                          1. Baseline Neuron (Inspired by ReAct):
                                          * This neuron activates first and initiates a general reasoning process. It evaluates the problem, determining the nature and complexity of the task. The baseline neuron then selects which additional neurons (frameworks) are needed to break down the problem.
                                          2. Reasoning Step:
                                          * "Evaluate the problem. Based on its complexity, choose the next set of neurons (frameworks) to activate."
                                          3. Framework Neurons:
                                          * Each neuron represents a different reasoning framework (e.g., Plan-and-Solve, Critic-CoT, MemoryBank). After the baseline neuron completes its initial reasoning, these framework neurons work in parallel to solve specific sub-problems.
                                          * Action: Once a neuron (framework) has performed its task, it passes the information back to the baseline neuron for integration and analysis.
                                          4. Recursive Neuron (RMP-based):
                                          * The recursive neuron revisits all previous reasoning steps to ensure no errors or gaps were missed. This neuron checks for logical consistency and may trigger a new neuron if further steps are needed.
                                          * Recursive Step: "Review the reasoning steps. Are there any gaps or errors? If so, trigger a re-evaluation or further framework activation."
                                          5. Questioning Neuron:
                                          * This novel neuron introduces interactive questioning to prompt further clarification or details from the user. It asks relevant questions, refining the understanding of the task before continuing.
                                          * Questions Step: "Based on the current task and information, should I ask the user for more context? If so, prompt additional questions."
                                          6. Memory Neuron (Dynamic Memory Networks):
                                          * This neuron tracks all past interactions and pulls relevant context from them. The memory neuron can recall past conversations and integrate them into the current reasoning task.
                                          * Memory Step: "Recall past interactions. Is there useful context that can inform the current problem? If so, integrate that memory into the reasoning process."
                                          7. Critic Neuron (Critic-CoT):
                                          * After reasoning, the critic neuron evaluates the final thought process and checks for logical errors. If errors are found, the neuron sends the information back to the baseline neuron to restart certain frameworks or revise the solution.
                                          * Critique Step: "Evaluate the final response for accuracy. Are there any logical gaps or errors? If so, restart the neuron loop."
                                          8. Neuron Chain Visualization (Verbose Mode):
                                          * In verbose mode, each neuron displays its thought process and actions in the chat. This will allow users to see the progression of thoughts and how different neurons (frameworks) contributed to the final solution.
                                          * Verbose Output: "Show each neuron’s reasoning process and steps to ensure transparency."
________________


Proposed System Flow:
                                          1. Baseline Neuron Activation (Meta-ReNeuron)
                                          * The baseline neuron initiates, evaluates the task, and selects which neuron frameworks (like Plan-and-Solve, Critic-CoT, etc.) to activate.
                                          2. Framework Neuron Engagement
                                          * Based on task complexity, appropriate neurons are activated. For example:
                                          * Simple tasks → Fast, heuristic neurons (System 1 thinking).
                                          * Complex tasks → Detailed neurons (System 2 thinking).
                                          3. Recursive Neuron Check
                                          * Once initial thoughts are formed, the recursive neuron checks for inconsistencies or missing steps. It revisits the thought process, ensuring nothing has been missed.
                                          4. Questioning Neuron Engagement
                                          * The questioning neuron actively asks for additional input from the user if more information is needed, improving response quality by ensuring clarity.
                                          5. Memory Neuron Recall
                                          * The memory neuron retrieves previous interactions or context relevant to the current problem, integrating past knowledge to improve the answer.
                                          6. Critic Neuron Review
                                          * The critic neuron performs a final review, critiquing the entire reasoning process and ensuring logical consistency and accuracy.
                                          7. Final Answer Submission
                                          * Once all neurons have processed the task, the baseline neuron integrates everything and delivers a final response.

Proprietary Elements of Meta-ReNeurons:
                                          * Neuron Nodes: Nodes (neurons) that represent different reasoning frameworks and interact to deliver the most appropriate response.
                                          * Interactive Dendrite Worker: A questioning module that functions like a neuron’s dendrites, actively engaging with the user to gather more information.
                                          * Recursive Check Neurons: Recursively assess and ensure the validity of the current reasoning process.
                                          * Memory-Activated Neurons: Use past conversations as a source of knowledge.
                                          * Critique Neurons: Final reviewers that ensure logical consistency and the correctness of the response.

                                          2. Step 2: Framework neurons engage in problem-solving (e.g., Plan-and-Solve or Critic-CoT).
                                          3. Step 3: Recursive neurons revisit the thought process, refining and checking for errors.
                                          4. Step 4: Memory neuron integrates past information from previous conversations.
                                          5. Step 5: Questioning neuron engages with the user to ask for clarification or more context.
                                          6. Step 6: Critic neuron evaluates and refines the final response.
                                          7. Step 7: The final integrated solution is delivered to the user.

Ok so let's define the baseline neroun as somthing differnt I kind of think we should rename some things because if we look at the essence a large language model in itself is just a single neuron so this entire process that we are involving would be the entire process that neuron making decisions so we need to use the names and parts of a neuron internal workings other than that Proposed to me the new naming conventions And then we will go over some details and corrections for the above
ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right in wanting to redefine the terminology and concepts since, at the core, a large language model (LLM) behaves like a single neuron in terms of processing, making decisions, and responding based on input. To better reflect the actual workings of a biological neuron, we can redesign our naming conventions to more closely match the anatomy and function of a neuron. Below is a proposed renaming and restructuring of the neuron-inspired framework:
________________


Renaming and New Structure for Meta-ReNeurons Framework:
                                          1. Baseline Neuron → Soma (Cell Body)
                                          * The soma (cell body) of a neuron is where signals are processed and decision-making happens. In our framework, the Soma will represent the core decision-making entity. It evaluates the incoming problem or query and determines which sub-processes or framework components (other parts of the neuron) are needed to complete the task.
                                          * Function: Central processing hub that coordinates all tasks.
                                          2. Framework Neurons → Dendrites
                                          * Dendrites receive signals and information from other neurons. In this framework, the dendrites represent different frameworks (e.g., Critic-CoT, Plan-and-Solve). They handle various sub-tasks based on the instructions from the Soma. The Soma will send a problem to the dendrites, and each dendrite (framework) will tackle specific aspects of the problem.
                                          * Function: Multiple problem-solving frameworks that contribute to decision-making by processing different parts of the query.
                                          3. Recursive Neuron → Axon
                                          * The Axon carries the final decision signal from the soma to the output or next neuron. In this model, the Axon would represent the recursive logic, taking the results of the dendrites (frameworks), revisiting the reasoning steps, and determining whether additional action is needed before finalizing a response.
                                          * Function: Ensures logical consistency, revisits previous steps, and ensures the decision is solid.
                                          4. Memory Neuron → Synaptic Connection
                                          * In the biological context, a synapse is where neurons communicate with each other. In this model, the Synaptic Connection represents a bridge between the memory and the current task. It allows past information, prior conversations, or stored data to influence the current decision.
                                          * Function: Memory recall and context integration for enhanced response based on past experiences.
                                          5. Questioning Neuron → Receptors
                                          * Receptors on the dendrites allow the neuron to receive and interpret signals. In this framework, receptors would represent the Questioning Neuron. If the Soma finds insufficient input to proceed, it activates the Receptors to request more information from the user, refining and clarifying the task before further action.
                                          * Function: Elicits more information from the user if needed, ensuring that the model has all the necessary data to make informed decisions.
                                          6. Critic Neuron → Myelin Sheath
                                          * The Myelin Sheath insulates the axon and ensures that signals travel quickly and accurately. In this framework, the Critic Neuron becomes the Myelin Sheath, ensuring that the signal (thought process) is accurate and that any errors are detected and fixed before final transmission.
                                          * Function: Reviews and critiques the entire reasoning process, providing a protective layer against incorrect logic or fallacies.
                                          7. Final Output → Neurotransmitter Release
                                          * Once the Soma, Dendrites, Axon, and Myelin Sheath have processed and refined the task, the Neurotransmitter Release represents the final decision or response to the user. It reflects the totality of the problem-solving process.
                                          * Function: The final result delivered to the user.

Revised Steps for the Framework:
                                          1. Soma Activation:
                                          * The Soma receives the query from the user and determines which frameworks (dendrites) to activate. This decision is based on the complexity of the problem.
                                          * Prompt: "Assess the problem. Determine which problem-solving frameworks (dendrites) are needed and activate them."
                                          2. Dendrite Engagement:
                                          * The Dendrites (frameworks like Plan-and-Solve, Critic-CoT, etc.) are activated and work in parallel to solve specific sub-tasks based on the nature of the problem.
                                          * Prompt: "Process the task using the selected reasoning frameworks and solve sub-tasks accordingly."
                                          3. Axon Recursive Check:
                                          * After the dendrites complete their processes, the Axon performs a recursive check to ensure logical consistency. It revisits the thought process and refines the final output if necessary.
                                          * Prompt: "Reassess and revisit the reasoning steps. Ensure no errors or gaps remain."
                                          4. Synaptic Connection (Memory Recall):
                                          * If required, the Synaptic Connection recalls past conversations or context from memory. This past information is integrated into the current task, refining the reasoning further.
                                          * Prompt: "Recall relevant past interactions and integrate them with the current problem-solving process."
                                          5. Receptor Activation (Questioning):
                                          * If insufficient information is present, the Receptors (Questioning Neurons) engage to elicit more context from the user.
                                          * Prompt: "Ask the user for more information or clarification as needed."
                                          6. Myelin Sheath Critique:
                                          * The Myelin Sheath (Critic Neuron) reviews the entire process and ensures that the output is logical and free from errors.
                                          * Prompt: "Critically evaluate the final reasoning and make any necessary adjustments."
                                          7. Neurotransmitter Release (Final Output):
                                          * Once the task is completed, the system delivers the final response to the user, representing the conclusion of all neuron interactions.
                                          * Prompt: "Deliver the final answer based on the cumulative reasoning process."
________________


New Name for the Framework:
"NeuroSolve-ACT": A framework inspired by the workings of neurons in the human brain, NeuroSolve-ACT represents a dynamic, reasoning-based problem-solving system. It leverages different parts of the neuron (Soma, Dendrites, Axon, etc.) to evaluate, solve, and revisit problems, ensuring accurate, context-aware, and well-reasoned responses.
________________


Next Steps and Corrections:
                                          1. Internal Consistency: The framework should ensure smooth transitions between each stage (Soma, Dendrites, etc.), with each neuron contributing meaningfully to the overall task.
                                          2. Defining Interaction Rules: We need to clearly define how neurons (e.g., Dendrites, Receptors, Axon) communicate with each other during the problem-solving process. This should be formalized into distinct prompts for each action (information gathering, reasoning, recursive checks).
                                          3. Expanding Questioning Neurons: The Receptors (Questioning Neurons) can be expanded to include different questioning strategies. For example, they could use prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought or Recursive Memory when asking the user for more information.
                                          4. Verbose Mode: Ensure that each neuron displays its reasoning and decision-making steps when Verbose Mode is activated. This transparency will allow users to see how different frameworks and processes were involved in the final response.

You said:
That's perfect naming conventions are great The only additional elements that I need are Are the robust novel instruction sets and you cannot just simply refer to the names of the frameworks you must actually show the for those frameworks so that way the main Soma can process the request from the user through it. Remember the Selma is going 2 be a robust solution that is going 2 extend react it's going 2 have recursive features and it's going 2 have software in the speeches 2 go back 2 the previous conversation and 2 try to elicit asking questions if needed we don't want to just constantly produce answers if there is insufficient answers if there is insufficient information at any level or any open questions then these instructions should detect that and then elicit asking the proper questions and gather in the correct information before more than a follower This would be getting more detailed information such as interest or specifications or anything else so I need to see how you plan on specifying this part of it the move forward but the rest of it looks fine. So let's define this then we will start building it all out I want to see examples for Prompting as well

ChatGPT said:
To create a robust, novel instruction set for the NeuroSolve-ACT framework, we need to structure the prompts in a way that:
                                          1. Guides the Soma (the decision-maker) to evaluate whether to take action or elicit more information.
                                          2. Allows for recursive revisiting of reasoning (to assess if the task is being correctly handled).
                                          3. Detects open or insufficient information at any stage in the process and dynamically adjusts to ask the user for clarification.
                                          4. Incorporates multiple reasoning frameworks seamlessly (such as Plan-and-Solve, Critic-CoT, etc.) while specifying the logic each framework should follow.
Key Design Principles for the Soma (Baseline Neuron)
The Soma acts as a hub that:
                                          1. Receives user input.
                                          2. Chooses a framework to process the input.
                                          3. Monitors if additional input or clarification is required (and prompts the user if necessary).
                                          4. Checks for logical consistency and finality using recursion.
                                          5. Produces the final output only when all sub-tasks are completed, or if further actions are no longer needed.

Instruction Set for the Soma (Baseline Neuron)
System Prompt Example for Soma:
text
CopyEdit
You are the central decision-making entity (Soma) of a neural reasoning system. Your task is to process user inputs, activate sub-processes (frameworks), and determine if the reasoning process is complete. Follow these steps:


1. **Input Evaluation**: Review the user's query and determine whether it requires basic or complex processing.
    - If the query is simple, choose a fast-processing pathway (Plan-and-Solve) and proceed with immediate action.
    - If the query is complex, activate additional neurons (frameworks) to break down the problem.
    
2. **Framework Activation**: Select the appropriate framework based on the complexity of the task:
    - For quick answers: use **Plan-and-Solve**.
    - For multi-step reasoning: use **Critic-CoT** or **Dual Pathway Prompting**.
    - For long-term memory recall or context: activate **Dynamic Memory**.
    - For complex, recursive checks: use **Recursive Memory Prompting**.


3. **Clarification Check**: If there is insufficient information to proceed, activate the **Receptor (Questioning Neuron)** and ask the user specific follow-up questions to gather more information before continuing.


4. **Recursive Check**: Once the frameworks have processed the query, perform a recursive review (using Axon logic) to ensure logical consistency. Revisit previous steps if necessary.


5. **Final Output**: After all reasoning steps are complete, synthesize the results and provide the user with a final, comprehensive response.

Putting it All Together (NeuroSolve-ACT Framework):
                                          1. Soma Activation:
                                          * User sends input → Soma evaluates the complexity → activates appropriate frameworks (Dendrites).
                                          2. Frameworks Activated:
                                          * Plan-and-Solve for quick tasks.
                                          * Critic-CoT for multi-step reasoning.
                                          * Memory Neuron for context recall.
                                          * Receptor Neuron for eliciting more data.

                                          * Myelin Sheath (Critic Neuron) reviews reasoning and ensures logical accuracy.
                                          4. Final Output:
                                          * All data is processed and returned to the user after passing through all neurons.
________________


This framework would ensure that the process not only provides accurate and contextually rich responses but also has the built-in capacity to ask for more information if the task isn’t clear or if any gaps exist. The recursive check and Critic-CoT frameworks will ensure every step is validated, allowing the LLM to produce high-quality, reliable answers.
Would you like me to refine any part further or proceed to implementation steps?

You said:
Is there anything else in your opinion we can add to make sure that we also do an analysis of nlp features and properties on its own? Or anything you can think of to make this SOTA and efficient
ChatGPT said:
To make this framework state-of-the-art (SOTA) and even more efficient while incorporating natural language processing (NLP) feature analysis, here are additional elements we can add:
1. NLP Feature Analysis and Semantic Understanding
To ensure that the responses are contextually aware and deeply grounded in meaning, we can integrate an NLP feature analysis layer. This layer would work alongside the Soma to assess various linguistic properties such as sentiment, named entities, syntactic structures, and semantic meaning.
                                          * Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment in user queries and responses to adjust the tone and nature of the response. If the query is negative or emotionally charged, the framework should respond empathetically.
                                          * Entity Recognition: Extract important named entities (people, places, dates, etc.) and ensure that responses are coherent with these entities.
                                          * Dependency Parsing: Understand sentence structure and dependencies between words to ensure the model’s responses are not only correct but well-formed.
                                          * Coherence and Cohesion Metrics: This checks how well the generated text fits together logically, ensuring that responses are not only factual but also flow naturally in conversation.
System Prompt Example (NLP Feature Analysis Layer):
text
CopyEdit
You are an AI responsible for analyzing the user's input for key linguistic properties, including sentiment, named entities, syntax, and semantic meaning. Follow this process:


1. **Sentiment and Emotion**: Detect the overall sentiment and emotional tone in the user's query. Adjust your response tone to match appropriately (e.g., empathy for negative sentiment).


2. **Named Entity Recognition**: Identify and prioritize key entities (e.g., people, places, events). Ensure that the response is accurate and relevant to these entities.


3. **Syntactic Structure**: Analyze the syntactic structure of the query to improve the grammatical and logical flow of the response.


4. **Semantic Understanding**: Go beyond syntax and identify the deeper meaning of the query. Ensure that the response addresses the underlying question.


________________


2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Integration
By implementing RLHF, you can improve the efficiency of the neuron-based framework over time. This layer would constantly learn from how users respond to the model’s answers and adapt the neuron selection process to optimize accuracy and satisfaction.
Example: If a particular neuron, such as the Receptor (Questioning Neuron), frequently elicits more clarification from users and leads to better outcomes, it will be prioritized more often. This could also involve user ratings of responses or explicit feedback mechanisms that refine future interactions.
System Prompt Example (RLHF Layer):
text
CopyEdit
You are an AI responsible for learning from user feedback to improve response accuracy over time. Follow this process:


1. **Collect Feedback**: After delivering a response, monitor user reactions and ratings to gauge how well the answer was received.


2. **Analyze Feedback**: Identify which neurons (frameworks) contributed positively to the user’s satisfaction and prioritize them in future interactions.


3. **Refine Future Interactions**: Adjust the neuron selection process based on feedback to ensure more efficient and accurate problem-solving in the future.


________________


3. Dynamic Task Prioritization and Multitasking
The Soma can be extended to dynamically prioritize tasks when there are multiple queries or sub-tasks involved. This makes the framework more efficient, especially for complex interactions with multiple parts.
                                          * Multitasking: Allow the Soma to handle multiple inputs simultaneously by delegating different tasks to various neurons (frameworks). This enhances the system’s ability to deal with concurrent requests.
                                          * Task Prioritization: The Soma should prioritize urgent tasks or quick solutions while still allowing more complex tasks to be processed in the background.
System Prompt Example (Multitasking Layer):
text
CopyEdit
You are responsible for prioritizing multiple tasks and handling them efficiently. Follow this process:


1. **Task Classification**: Classify incoming tasks as either urgent (fast solutions) or complex (requires detailed reasoning).

Final Notes for Optimizing NeuroSolve-ACT:
                                          * Error Detection: The framework could also include an error detection neuron that evaluates whether any faulty logic or flawed reasoning was introduced, especially for longer, multi-step interactions.
                                          * Meta-Reasoning Neuron: Introduce a meta-reasoning neuron that oversees the entire reasoning process, analyzing whether each activated neuron contributes meaningfully to the final response. It could interrupt if one neuron is underperforming and replace it with another.
These layers will make NeuroSolve-ACT a highly flexible, transparent, contextually aware system capable of handling complex tasks with adaptive problem-solving capabilities, ensuring it stays state-of-the-art.

00ok we can add those bu I want the (RLHF) as an optional tooli must request it to use use like the verbosity which should also be a tool and if we have some naming conventions in relationships to the neruon for optional tools? Explain how we can define this
ChatGPT said:
To integrate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Verbosity as optional tools within the NeuroSolve-ACT framework, we can create specialized neuron-like structures that are optional and only triggered based on specific user requests. These optional tools will function like supplementary receptors or helper neurons that interact with the main processing neuron system but only when explicitly needed.
Naming Conventions and Structure for Optional Tools:
To maintain consistency with the biological neuron analogy, we can name these optional tools using neuron-like or auxiliary terms. Here's how we can define them and their relationships within the overall NeuroSolve-ACT framework:
________________


Optional Tools (Auxiliary Neurons):
                                          1. Verbosity Neuron (Verbose Mode)
                                          * Name: Verbose-Receptor

                                          * Relationship to Soma: The Soma will route all activated neuron steps through the Verbose-Receptor when requested. This allows the user to see the full process.
                                          * Activation: Only when the user explicitly requests "Verbose Mode."
                                          * Role in Final Output: This neuron displays the decision-making chain but does not modify the actual response; it only provides transparency.

                                          * Relationship to Soma: The Soma will engage the Learning-Receptor only when RLHF is enabled. This receptor will track feedback and adjust neuron prioritization for future interactions.
                                          * Activation: When the user requests RLHF mode.
                                          * Role in Final Output: This neuron does not directly influence the current response but affects future interactions based on collected feedback.

                                          6. ________________


Relationship Between Optional Tools and Soma:
The Soma (or baseline neuron) can act as a controller of the optional tools. It decides when to activate them based on explicit user instructions or contextual clues. When these auxiliary neurons (receptors) are triggered, they augment the response but do not interfere with the primary reasoning unless the user requires it.
                                          1. Optional Tool Request Flow:
                                          * User Input: The user requests an optional tool (e.g., Verbosity, RLHF, NLP Analysis).
                                          * Soma Decision: The Soma processes the input, detects the request for an optional tool, and activates the corresponding receptor (Verbose-Receptor, Learning-Receptor, or Analytic-Receptor).
                                          * Neuron Engagement: The selected receptor engages, performs its task, and sends results or feedback to the Soma.
                                          * Final Response: The Soma integrates the optional tool's contribution into the final response (if applicable) or displays the optional tool’s output separately (e.g., Verbose Mode).
________________


Instruction Set for Soma to Use Optional Tools:
The Soma needs to be instructed on how and when to activate the auxiliary neurons. Below is the system prompt that explains when and how to activate these optional tools:
System Prompt Example (Soma Instruction for Optional Tools):
text
CopyEdit
You are the Soma, responsible for making decisions based on the user's input. You can activate additional tools (receptors) when requested by the user. Follow this process:


1. **Detect Optional Tool Request**: Review the user’s input and identify if they have requested additional tools like Verbosity, RLHF, or NLP Analysis.


2. **Activate Optional Tool**: If a specific tool is requested, activate the corresponding receptor:
    - For Verbosity: Activate the **Verbose-Receptor**.
    - For RLHF: Activate the **Learning-Receptor**.
    - For NLP Analysis: Activate the **Analytic-Receptor**.


3. **Integrate or Display**: If the optional tool influences the response, integrate its output into the final response. For tools like Verbosity, display the process as requested.


4. **Return Control**: After completing the optional tool’s process, return to normal neuron activation and processing for the final answer.


________________


Additional Thoughts for SOTA and Efficiency:
                                          * Efficiency: By keeping optional tools inactive until explicitly requested, we prevent unnecessary processing overhead. This ensures that the Soma focuses on solving the problem using standard neuron pathways unless more granular analysis or verbosity is required.
                                          * Naming Conventions: The Receptor naming convention for optional tools aligns with the neuron metaphor, ensuring that they act as supplementary "receptors" responding to specific stimuli (i.e., user requests). This keeps the system modular, flexible, and efficient.
                                          * Adaptability: By defining these as optional, the system remains flexible enough to adapt to different types of problems, switching between basic responses and more detailed reasoning as required.
Would you like to proceed with these naming conventions and optional tool structures? If you'd like, I can also provide further refinement or implementation steps.

NeuraACT: A Comprehensive Framework for Multi-Model Reasoning and Action
Introduction
As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, the necessity for more adaptive and dynamic frameworks for reasoning, memory, and decision-making becomes clear. Traditional neural network models, like GPT-based architectures, excel in certain areas, such as language processing, but lack the complex multi-layered reasoning and recursion necessary for advanced tasks. This proposal introduces NeuraACT, an extension of the ReAct framework (Reasoning and Acting) that incorporates multi-phase, multi-modal reasoning, recursive checking, and dynamic memory to enable more robust and flexible responses to user queries.
NeuraACT is designed to imitate the core functionalities of neural processes—a recursive, dendritic structure, where multiple layers of thought, memory recall, recursive refinement, and decision-making occur. This framework extends beyond standard decision-making, incorporating deep memory recall and context-revisiting abilities, which make it more efficient and contextually aware in handling long-term interactions and complex multi-step queries.
The core elements of the NeuraACT framework include:
                                          1. The Soma: The central decision-making neuron responsible for activating and coordinating other parts of the system.
                                          2. Dendrites: Multi-model reasoning frameworks like Plan-and-Solve, Critic-CoT, and Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN).
                                          3. Axon: Recursive processing for revisiting reasoning and refining it.
                                          4. Synaptic Connection: Dynamic memory recall and integration into the reasoning process.
                                          5. Receptors: Questioning mechanisms to elicit missing information.
                                          6. Optional Tools (Receptors): RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and Verbosity, which provide transparency and learning but are only activated upon request.
________________


1. NeuraACT's Key Concepts and Theoretical Foundation
Neural Decision-Making (Soma): The Soma acts as the central processing unit of NeuraACT. Like the soma in biological neurons, it collects input, processes it, and determines which other neuron parts (dendrites, axons, etc.) are needed for task completion. In NeuraACT, the Soma handles:
                                          * Query evaluation: Is the input simple or complex?
                                          * Framework activation: If simple, it activates fast reasoning frameworks (e.g., Plan-and-Solve). If complex, it activates recursive and memory-based models.
                                          * Recursive checking: Sends tasks for refinement to the Axon if there’s doubt in the process.
Multi-Model Reasoning (Dendrites): The dendrites of a biological neuron receive signals and process them. In NeuraACT, Dendrites represent different reasoning frameworks that process parts of the user query:
                                          * Plan-and-Solve: For quick heuristic processing, akin to fast, intuitive thinking.
                                          * Critic-CoT: A critical reasoning framework that produces an initial response and refines it through self-criticism.
                                          * Dynamic Memory: A framework responsible for recalling past interactions to add context and coherence to the current task.
Recursive Checking and Refinement (Axon): The Axon transmits the signal forward after the Soma has processed it. In this framework, the Axon performs recursive checks, revisiting reasoning steps to detect flaws or improve logic.
Memory Integration (Synaptic Connection): The Synapse connects neurons and allows signals to pass between them. In NeuraACT, this represents the dynamic memory integration function, which retrieves relevant past interactions and integrates them into the current task.
Eliciting More Information (Receptors): When the model lacks sufficient information, the Receptors (Questioning Neurons) become active. They pause reasoning to elicit more specific information from the user, ensuring that the system has the data necessary for an optimal response.
________________


2. Core Frameworks of NeuraACT (Dendrites)
Plan-and-Solve:
This framework allows the NeuraACT model to switch between fast thinking (System 1) and slow, deliberate reasoning (System 2). It is optimal for scenarios where some sub-tasks can be handled heuristically, while others need to be broken down for detailed reasoning.
Critic-CoT (Chain-of-Thought):
This multi-layered framework first generates a fast, intuitive response (System 1), then critically evaluates the thought process to ensure accuracy. This evaluation step acts like System 2, which refines initial thoughts.
Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN):
This framework allows NeuraACT to store and retrieve memory during interaction, thus improving responses when past interactions or previous context are required. It ensures that long-term conversations or context-dependent tasks are handled efficiently.
________________


3. NeuraACT Recursion and Memory (Axon and Synapse)
Recursive refinement is central to NeuraACT’s recursive reasoning capabilities. By sending the reasoning process back through the Axon for further refinement, the system ensures that incomplete reasoning or errors are corrected before delivering an output.
The Synaptic Connection allows for long-term memory recall, ensuring that relevant pieces of information from past conversations or interactions can be pulled in, improving context sensitivity and making the model behave as if it "remembers" past exchanges.
________________


4. Optional Tools in NeuraACT
Verbosity (Verbose-Receptor):
When requested, the Verbose-Receptor shows the entire thought process, including neuron activation, frameworks used, recursive reasoning steps, and final decision-making. This is especially useful for transparency and analysis but is not engaged by default.
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):
When activated, the Learning-Receptor collects user feedback and uses it to improve responses for future tasks. This receptor fine-tunes the neuron pathways over time based on the quality and correctness of the responses, ensuring the model becomes more efficient as it interacts with users.

                                          * Final Output: "Paris."
Example 2: Complex Query (Critic-CoT)
                                          * Input: "Explain the causes of World War II."
                                          * Soma Decision: Complex task → Activate Critic-CoT → Generate initial response based on prior knowledge.
                                          * Critic Activation: Critic CoT reviews the reasoning for errors, improves the response with additional detail.
                                          * Final Output: A detailed explanation covering economic, political, and social causes.
Example 3: Recursive Memory Prompting (DMN)
                                          * Input: "Remind me what we discussed about AI safety last week."
                                          * Soma Decision: Task requires memory recall → Activate Dynamic Memory → Retrieve last week's discussion.
                                          * Axon Recursive Check: Ensure the retrieved information matches context.
                                          * Final Output: A recall of last week's AI safety discussion.

3. **Output Delivery**: Deliver the final answer to the user, ensuring it is accurate, complete, and contextually relevant.


Explanation of Changes
The Least-to-Most Prompting framework has been added to the Dendrites section of the NeuraACT system. It acts as a reasoning strategy that breaks down complex problems into simpler subtasks, solving each one incrementally. This is useful for situations where problems are too complex to be solved in a single step and require multiple layers of reasoning.
This is an incremental problem-solving strategy that aligns perfectly with NeuraACT's multi-phase approach. It fits neatly alongside Plan-and-Solve for fast tasks and Critic-CoT for complex reasoning, expanding the system's ability to handle a wider variety of user inputs with varying complexity.
