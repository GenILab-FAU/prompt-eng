Category 1: Foundational Prompting Approaches

These methods represent the most classic or foundational strategies of using language models without heavy external augmentation or elaborate multi-step structures. They often revolve around zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, in-context strategies, or instruction-based approaches. They focus primarily on how many examples or instructions are presented in the prompt, rather than employing complex reasoning chains or specialized memory systems.

Category 2: Chain-of-Thought and Other Reasoning-Focused Methods

This group is dedicated to step-by-step, structured reasoning paradigms.

Category 4: Tool Use, Multi-Agent Interaction, and External Integration

In these methods, prompting strategies guide the language model to use external tools, coordinate with agent frameworks, or integrate specialized APIs. They may revolve around sending the model’s partial thoughts or requests to external systems (search engines, calculators, code interpreters) or orchestrating multiple agents.

These methods emphasize checking or verifying intermediate or final answers, engaging in self-reflection, or critiquing outputs to improve correctness. They can involve meta-cognition, iterative feedback loops, adversarial testing, and refinements that push the model to re-evaluate its own responses.

Multimodal Prompting (MP)
Cross-Lingual Prompting (CLP)
Category 9: Persona, Role-Based, and Skill-Oriented

These methods highlight using specialized roles or personas in prompts, or focusing on distinct “skills” that the model can adopt. By setting a persona, skill profile, or role, the language model tailors its style and output structure to suit that perspective.
Contextual-Aware Prompting (CAP) (partly about user role and context)
Skill-Specific Prompting (listed also under planning, but it fits well here for skill dimension)
Role-Based Instruction Prompting (RBIP)

Category 10: Novel, Hybrid, or Less-Established Approaches

Finally, many methods do not tie neatly into one of the more widely recognized families (chain-of-thought, memory augmentation, tuning, planning, verification, etc.). These appear to be emerging or proposed techniques that blend multiple elements or introduce new naming without widely recognized references. They often represent experimental frameworks that extend existing ideas in unique ways.
